The derivative of \(  f(x) \) is $f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x)$

The definite Integral of a function \( f(x) \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is given by: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$
CS Examples for fun:

The logical OR between \( A \) and \( B \) is represented by the term $A \lor B$

The logical AND between \( A \) and \( B \) is represented by the term $A \land B$

The logical X-OR between \( A \) and \( B \) is represented by the term $A \oplus B$

Other symbols:

$A \Rightarrow B$

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

$\lim_{ x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$
